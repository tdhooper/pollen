* colour deformation control
* mesh deformed normals
* lighting
* background + environment
* holes
* texture/mesh warping control
* alternative polyhedra
* can instancing improve performance?

* pause/save
* gallery
    * different app or mode?
    * can be mode, that live updates
    * needs a server


Gallery design

* Microscope view - circular
* Really shallow DOF?
    * Play with focus
* When adding a pollenet, break focus, then slide it into view while focusing
* Simple fluid sim
* Switch between zoom levels
* Several focal planes?
* Make more unique shapes bigger?



we have N particles
just use a voronoi distribution
constrain within bounding circle
when adding, choose a random place out of view, and tween the camera to it


steps:
* randomly place initial particles
* make them repel (voronoi diagram)
** gpu or cpu?
** cpu means new ones are easy to find
** gpu opens up for particle sim
** cpu is easier to prototype
* 


Adding a pollenet
* remove oldest
** shrink
** place in oldest place
** grow to oldest size

* could always make it big, ans shrink everyone else
